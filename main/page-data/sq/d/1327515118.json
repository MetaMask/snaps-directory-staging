For instance, Uniswap, ENS, Lens Protocol etc. are channels on Push Protocol that you can opt-in to.\\n- Notifications: Notifications are alerts from any of the channels that user opts-in to. For example, loan liquidation alerts, new governance proposals, ENS domain name expiry or web3 news updates.\\n\\n—-Web3 users often interact with a plethora of decentralized applications (dapps) ranging from DeFi tools, to NFT marketplaces to media channels. With so many dapps, staying updated often demands constant attention and regular logins, resulting in an overwhelming user experience.\\n\\nThe Push Snap aims to resolve this issue by bringing all essential updates for the user directly into their MetaMask wallet. This eliminates the need to bounce between multiple web3 applications as the user's MetaMask wallet now acts as a unified notification center for all imperative web3 updates.\\n\\nGet Started in 4-Simple Steps\\n\\n1. Installation: Click on 'Add to MetaMask' button shown above. This initiates the process of adding the Push Snap to your MetaMask wallet.\\n2.

After being stored, the key never leaves the Nocturne Snap and is only accessed by the Snap for producing signatures.\\n\\nRegistering Your Canonical Address\\nA canonical Nocturne address is a public address that can be used to generate more Nocturne stealth addresses that belong to the owner of the corresponding Nocturne spending key. One of the last steps in the user-onboarding flow is for the user to register their canonical Nocturne address against their public Ethereum address to facilitate a convenient mapping. The Nocturne Snap will prompt the user to sign a message proving that they own the canonical Nocturne address. After that, the user generates a ZKP of the signature and then submits it to the canonical address registry contract to link their Nocturne address to their public wallet.\\n\\nSigning Operations\\nAll operations that spend private funds, (transferring ETH to a fresh address, performing a private swap, etc) must be authorized from your Nocturne spending key. When a user wants to perform an operation, the Nocturne Snap will prompt the user to confirm they would like to authorize the operation. If the user hits 'Confirm,' the Snap will sign the operation with the user's spending key, authorizing the operation.\",\"n\":0.062}}},{\"i\":83,\"$\":{\"0\":{\"v\":\"Web3 Antivirus\",\"n\":0.707},\"1\":{\"v\":\"npm:@web3-antivirus/web3-antivirus-snap\",\"n\":1},\"2\":{\"v\":\"Receive alerts about scams and risks like honeypots, phishing, and malicious contracts.\",\"n\":0.289},\"3\":{\"v\":\"Have your Web3 security guard right in your wallet.

Unlike traditional digital signatures uniquely linked to one user, ring signatures obscure the actual author by linking multiple possible signers together in a “ring.”\\n\\nRing signatures preserve privacy and anonymity by obscuring the specific originator of a message. By grouping possible signers in a “ring,” there is no way to definitively pinpoint the actual individual who authored the content. This prevents transactions from being easily traced back to a single user. The larger the ring of possible signers, the more anonymity is provided to the real originator.\\n\\nRing signatures have been known to cryptographers for several years, but their use within the blockchain ecosystem has been limited. The Monero blockchain is noted as one of the first to employ this cryptographic solution at the protocol level. However, there is currently no complete, robust, and audited implementation of ring signatures adapted for the browser environment.

The EAS Snap converts this data into a clear, readable format. This ensures you're fully aware of the attestation's details, mitigating the risk of unintentional or malicious signings.\n\nKey Features\n- Attestation Decoding: Utilizes SchemaEncoder from the EAS SDK to decode attestation data, presenting it in a readable format.\n- Transaction Data Parsing: The snap parses Ethereum transaction data to identify if it is related to an EAS attestation, using ethers library.\n- Dynamic Content Rendering: It dynamically renders transaction details in the MetaMask UI, including schema, recipient, reference UID, expiration time, and revocability status, offering users a complete overview of the attestation they are about to sign.\n- Time Formatting: Utilizes dayjs with extended formats to display expiration times in a user-friendly manner.\n- GraphQL Integration: Communicates with EAS's GraphQL endpoint to fetch and display the schema associated with the attestation.\n- Data Decoding and Display: Decodes and displays each piece of attestation data using the fetched schema, allowing users to understand the specifics of what they are attesting.\n\nAfter installing the Snap, you can view insights in the transaction flow while interacting with an EAS contract.

The signature can then be verified by any third party without revealing the actual signer.\n\nIt supports two types of ring signatures: Spontaneous Anonymous Group signatures (SAG) and Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group signatures (LSAG). If you are using the SAG scheme, no one will ever know that you signed the message. Use the LSAG scheme if you want third parties to know you signed multiple messages without revealing your identity.\n\nFeatures:\n- Create an Ethereum account\n- Import an Ethereum account using a mnemonic\n- Export the snap addresses\n- Sign a message using SAG and LSAG with the snap\n- Verify a SAG or LSAG signature\n\nWhat are Ring Signatures?\nRing signatures are a type of digital signature that allows a group of users to sign a message anonymously. Unlike traditional digital signatures uniquely linked to one user, ring signatures obscure the actual author by linking multiple possible signers together in a “ring.”\n\nRing signatures preserve privacy and anonymity by obscuring the specific originator of a message. By grouping possible signers in a “ring,” there is no way to definitively pinpoint the actual individual who authored the content. This prevents transactions from being easily traced back to a single user. The larger the ring of possible signers, the more anonymity is provided to the real originator.\n\nRing signatures have been known to cryptographers for several years, but their use within the blockchain ecosystem has been limited. The Monero blockchain is noted as one of the first to employ this cryptographic solution at the protocol level. However, there is currently no complete, robust, and audited implementation of ring signatures adapted for the browser environment. This is where we come in!\n\nUseful links:\n- More about ring signatures: https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/RST01.pdf\n- SAG repository: https://github.com/Cypher-Laboratory/Alice-s-Ring-SAG-TS\n- LSAG repository: https://github.com/Cypher-Laboratory/Alice-s-Ring-LSAG-TS\n- Toolkit for integrating with dapps: https://github.com/Cypher-Laboratory/Alice-s-Ring-snap-toolkit."},{"snapId":"npm:@zenchain-protocol/zazen","name":"Zazen","summary":"Manage Zenchain validator node cloud access keys.","description":"Zazen Snap: Secure Cloud Access Key Management within MetaMask\n\nZazen is a MetaMask Snap that provides a secure, encrypted storage solution for your Zenchain validator node cloud access keys directly within MetaMask.
