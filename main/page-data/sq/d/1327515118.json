For instance, Uniswap, ENS, Lens Protocol etc. are channels on Push Protocol that you can opt-in to.\\n- Notifications: Notifications are alerts from any of the channels that user opts-in to. For example, loan liquidation alerts, new governance proposals, ENS domain name expiry or web3 news updates.\\n\\n—-Web3 users often interact with a plethora of decentralized applications (dapps) ranging from DeFi tools, to NFT marketplaces to media channels. With so many dapps, staying updated often demands constant attention and regular logins, resulting in an overwhelming user experience.\\n\\nThe Push Snap aims to resolve this issue by bringing all essential updates for the user directly into their MetaMask wallet. This eliminates the need to bounce between multiple web3 applications as the user's MetaMask wallet now acts as a unified notification center for all imperative web3 updates.\\n\\nGet Started in 4-Simple Steps\\n\\n1. Installation: Click on 'Add to MetaMask' button shown above. This initiates the process of adding the Push Snap to your MetaMask wallet.\\n2. Setting-Up Push Snap: Once installed, you should be prompted to visit Push dapp, i.e., https://app.push.org/snap. Visit the dApp to proceed with next steps.\\n3. Adding your Address: Once connected to the dapp, the Snap will require confirmation to add your address. Adding of address in the Snap means enabling your wallet to receive notifications.\\n4. Opt-In to Channels: Once address is added, simply click on Get Started.

Unlike traditional digital signatures uniquely linked to one user, ring signatures obscure the actual author by linking multiple possible signers together in a “ring.”\\n\\nRing signatures preserve privacy and anonymity by obscuring the specific originator of a message. By grouping possible signers in a “ring,” there is no way to definitively pinpoint the actual individual who authored the content. This prevents transactions from being easily traced back to a single user. The larger the ring of possible signers, the more anonymity is provided to the real originator.\\n\\nRing signatures have been known to cryptographers for several years, but their use within the blockchain ecosystem has been limited. The Monero blockchain is noted as one of the first to employ this cryptographic solution at the protocol level. However, there is currently no complete, robust, and audited implementation of ring signatures adapted for the browser environment.

Unlike traditional digital signatures uniquely linked to one user, ring signatures obscure the actual author by linking multiple possible signers together in a “ring.”\n\nRing signatures preserve privacy and anonymity by obscuring the specific originator of a message. By grouping possible signers in a “ring,” there is no way to definitively pinpoint the actual individual who authored the content. This prevents transactions from being easily traced back to a single user. The larger the ring of possible signers, the more anonymity is provided to the real originator.\n\nRing signatures have been known to cryptographers for several years, but their use within the blockchain ecosystem has been limited. The Monero blockchain is noted as one of the first to employ this cryptographic solution at the protocol level. However, there is currently no complete, robust, and audited implementation of ring signatures adapted for the browser environment. This is where we come in!\n\nUseful links:\n- More about ring signatures: https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/RST01.pdf\n- SAG repository: https://github.com/Cypher-Laboratory/Alice-s-Ring-SAG-TS\n- LSAG repository: https://github.com/Cypher-Laboratory/Alice-s-Ring-LSAG-TS\n- Toolkit for integrating with dapps: https://github.com/Cypher-Laboratory/Alice-s-Ring-snap-toolkit."},{"snapId":"npm:@token-kit/tapp-snap","name":"Tapp","summary":"Access Tapps (cross-platform mini apps) in MetaMask.","description":"Tapp Snap is a new way for Tapp users to access their own Tapps -- a new kind of cross-platform mini app linking with a token.\nAfter installation, Tapp users can go to the Tapp sites via installed Tapp to finish any onchain/offchain actions.\nThis Snap makes MetaMask a Tapp Store."},{"snapId":"npm:bitbadges-snap","name":"BitBadges","summary":"Gain insights into a user's BitBadges portfolio, allowing you to learn about their digital identity.","description":"The BitBadges Snap allows you to gain insights into a user's BitBadges portfolio, allowing you to learn about their digital identity.\n\nIt scans relevant addresses from a transaction and checks / displays custom criteria requirements, such as badge / NFT ownership, credentials, lists, protocols, attestations, and more.
